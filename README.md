Hello people,


Welcome to my project "CustomPCRGB"
In this project, i am gonna show you how to build your custom RGB lightning in your pc.

Needed: 
--Arduino UNO 
--Visual studio code with Visual Basic installed
--Arduino IDE
--RGB led(s)

Download the zip file from GitHub and flash arduino.h to your Arduino. Maybe you have to change the pins for your led. The standard pins are 5, 6 and 7 because this pins have PWM (Pulse With Modulation). Connect the RGB LEDs to the Arduino and connect your Arduino to your computer. Start ArduinoRGB.exe and select the comport of your Arduino. Then click on "Kleur kiezen" and choose a color. Now you can see the color you selected on your LED. 



If you have any questions or if something is going wrong, place a message in the tab "Issues" and i will respond ASAP.
